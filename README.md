# Welcome

My name is Steven (he/him), and I am an experimental psychologist.
I like to learn new things. More specifically, with the help of computational
models I try to get a better understanding of the human brain and how humans
behave.

If I am not chasing new knowledge, I like to do sports
(cycling, swimming, [chess](https://ratings.fide.com/profile/277541)).

# Current projects
## PhD student
As of September 2023, I am working on my PhD research in the
[Biological Psychology team](https://www.hf.uni-koeln.de/38105) of Prof Dr
Jan Peters at the University of Cologne. I am using computational models to
describe and predict human behaviour in decision-making tasks in order to
get a better understanding of the underlying processes.

## [Uncertainty](https://github.com/StevenGeysen/ScriptsThesisUncertainty)
With the help of Dr Anna Marzecová, I am continuing the work of my master
thesis, where we try to explain human behaviour under uncertainty with
reinforcement learning models.

## IT consultant
By accident, I became an IT consultant. You can ask me for help, ranging from
programming to data analysis.
### [Battenburg project](https://github.com/StevenGeysen/Battenburg)
Commisioned by [VIAS](https://www.vias.be/), I programmed several experiments
to study the visibility of the Belgian police.

# Past projects
## Research assistant
October 2022 - August 2023
As a research assistant in the
[Computational Neurology Research Group](https://computationalneurology.com/)
of Prof Dr Xenia Kobeleva, I created a fMRI preprocessing
[pipeline](https://indico.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/event/109/contributions/1068/,
'TRA poster') to prepare the analysis of the large fMRI datasets we use.
Additionally, I worked on a study about cognitive reserve where I tried to
predict cognitive functioning based on neuropathophysiological markes in
patients with Alzheimer's disease.
