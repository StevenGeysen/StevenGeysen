# Welcome

My name is Steven (he/him), and I am an experimental psychologist.
I like to learn new things. More specifically, with the help of computational
models I try to get a better understanding of the human brain and how humans behave.

If I am not chasing new knowledge, I like to do sports (cycling, swimming, [chess](https://ratings.fide.com/profile/277541)).

# Current projects
## [Uncertainty](https://github.com/StevenGeysen/ScriptsThesisUncertainty)
With the help of dr. Anna Marzecov√°, I am continuing the work of my master thesis,
where we try to explain human behaviour under uncertainty with reinforcement learning models.

It is a forever-project that I pick up whenever I have the time.

## Research assistant
As of October 2022 I am assisting [dr. Xenia Kobeleva](https://xenia-kobeleva.com/) in her research about Alzheimer's disease.
I created a fMRI preprocessing [pipeline](https://indico.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/event/109/contributions/1068/) for her
computational neurology team. Currently, I am working on a study about cognitive reserve.

## IT consultant
By accident, I am an IT consultant. You can ask me for help, ranging from programming to data analysis.
### [Battenburg project](https://github.com/StevenGeysen/Battenburg)
Commisioned by [VIAS](https://www.vias.be/), I programmed several experiments to study the visibility of the Belgian police.
