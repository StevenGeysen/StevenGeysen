# Welcome

My name is Steven (he/him), and I am an experimental psychologist.
I like to learn new things. More specifically, with the help of computational
models I try to get a better understanding of the human brain and how humans
behave.

If I am not chasing new knowledge, I like to do sports (bouldering,
[chess](https://ratings.fide.com/profile/277541), cycling, swimming).

# Current projects
## PhD student
As of September 2023, I am working as a doctoral researcher in the
[Biological Psychology team](https://www.hf.uni-koeln.de/38105) of Prof Dr
Jan Peters at the University of Cologne. I am using computational models to
describe and predict human behaviour in decision-making tasks in order to
get a better understanding of the underlying processes.

Currently, I am looking at changes in risky decision-making when people are
hungry or tired.

## IT consultant
As a side project, I am an IT consultant. I can be hired for a variety of 
IT related tasks, with a focus on data analysis.
### [Battenburg project](https://github.com/StevenGeysen/Battenburg)
An example of an earlier assignment. The Belgian road safety institute
[VIAS](https://www.vias.be/) contacted me to program several experiments
to study the visibility of the Belgian police. I created three reaction time
tasks (two with images, one with videos), and a preprocessing script for the
online data.

# Past projects
## Research assistant
October 2022 - August 2023
As a research assistant in the
[Computational Neurology Research Group](https://computationalneurology.com/)
of Prof Dr Xenia Kobeleva, I created a fMRI preprocessing
[pipeline](https://indico.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/event/109/contributions/1068/,
'TRA poster') to prepare the analysis of the large fMRI datasets we use.
Additionally, I worked on a study about cognitive reserve where I tried to
predict cognitive functioning based on neuropathophysiological markes in
patients with Alzheimer's disease.

## [Master thesis](https://github.com/StevenGeysen/ScriptsThesisUncertainty)
Under supervision of Dr Anna Marzecov√°, I tried to explain human behaviour
under uncertainty with reinforcement learning models. When I find the time,
I hope to continue this work since a lot more can be done.
