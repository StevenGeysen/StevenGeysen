# Welcome

My name is Steven (he/him), and I am an experimental psychologist.
I like to learn new things. More specifically, with the help of computational
models I try to get a better understanding of the human brain and how humans
behave.

If I am not chasing new knowledge, I like to do sports
(cycling, swimming, [chess](https://ratings.fide.com/profile/277541)).

# Current projects
## [Uncertainty](https://github.com/StevenGeysen/ScriptsThesisUncertainty)
With the help of Dr Anna Marzecov√°, I am continuing the work of my master
thesis, where we try to explain human behaviour under uncertainty with
reinforcement learning models.

## Research assistant
As of October 2022 I am assisting
[Dr Xenia Kobeleva](https://xenia-kobeleva.com/) in her research about
Alzheimer's disease. For the
[Computational Neurology Research Group](https://computationalneurology.com/)
I created a fMRI preprocessing
[pipeline](https://indico.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/event/109/contributions/1068/,
'TRA poster').
Currently, I am working on a study about cognitive reserve. I try to predict
the trajectory of Alzheimer's disease based on the cognitive reserve a patient
has.

## IT consultant
By accident, I am an IT consultant. You can ask me for help, ranging from
programming to data analysis.
### [Battenburg project](https://github.com/StevenGeysen/Battenburg)
Commisioned by [VIAS](https://www.vias.be/), I programmed several experiments
to study the visibility of the Belgian police.
