# Welcome

My name is Steven (he/him), and I am an experimental psychologist.
I like to learn how humans behave with the help of computational models.



# Current projects
## [Uncertainty](https://github.com/StevenGeysen/ScriptsThesisUncertainty)
With the help of dr. Anna Marzecov√°, I am continuing the work of my master thesis,
where we try to explain human behaviour under uncertainty with reinforcement learning models.


## Modelling Alzheimer's disease
As of October 2022 I am assisting [dr. Xenia Kobeleva](https://xenia-kobeleva.com/) in her research about Alzheimer's disease.


## Battenburg project
I am commisioned by [VIAS](https://www.vias.be/), to program several experiments to study the visibility of the Belgian police.
